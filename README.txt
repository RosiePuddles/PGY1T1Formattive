# The Environmental
> An example website focussing on climate change for my formative assessment of the programming gold module (year 1 term 1)

This site includes:
- Multiple dedicated pages
- Favicons!
- Dynamic colour themes for light and dark colour themes
- Data visualisation using choropleths made with D3

Please also note, there may be some parts of the site that while visually are correct, the content doesn't really make any sense; such as dates that don't exist. Unless grammatical, this is intentional.
